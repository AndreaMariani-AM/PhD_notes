- *Maria Bernabeu Aznar*  : Blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents entering toxins and infectious agents from the environment, pathogen plasomdium falciparum and malaria. Design synthetic BBB. Understanding how malaria can modulate and permeate through the blood brain barrier (BBB).
- *Anna Obenauf*:   Molecular factors of response and resistance to targeted and immunotherapies, guide rational combination therapies in cancer patients.
- *Serena Nik-Zainal*: Cancer genomics + evaluation of mutational signatures to understand aetiology that underpin cancers including environmental and endogenous DNA replicative/repair sources of mutagenesis.
- *Inigo Martincorena*: Characterising somatic mutation in healthy tissues, Exploring the role of somatic mutation in ageing and disease, Somatic mutation in other species
- *Miina Ollikainen*: obesity, aging and substance abuse in early life and in adulthood using discordant and concordant twin pairs and twin modelling + Epigenetics marks in complex diseases and traits, genome + epigenome alterations and interaction with environment/lifestyle to estimate  individual and joint effects on common disease progression and risk.
- *Andrea Baccarelli*: The study the effects of air pollution in health by different means: by epigenetics and molecular biology, epidemiology and computationally.
- *Fabian Theis*: scanpy guy, single cell guru, model single cell heterogeneities + ML for prediction in biology and biomedicine. He develops technologies that can be exploited for analysing environmental effects on a single cell level on human health.
- *Francesco Paolo Casale*:  development scalable tools for genetic association studies, deep learning models for imaging genetics, computational methods to study GxE (gene-environment interactions) and disease subtypes
- *Dirk Haller*: provided clear experimental evidence for the causal role of gut bacterial dysbiosis in the development of chronic ileal inflammation with subsequent failure of Paneth cell function.
- *Samantha Morris*: same thing as Fabian, developmental biology regeneration and reporgramming, tools to understand gene regulatory network that defines cell identity and lineage.
- *Fernanda Pinheiro*: prediction of ecological and evolutionary processes of pathogens to translate it into modern mecine.


DIRK, Fernanda switch them for some in the first option.
