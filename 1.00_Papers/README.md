# Organization

The idea is to have a directoy for each micro area in which the parper might fall into (like Polycomb, bioinfo, chromatin ...) , a single .md file for each paper i read with key point summarized. When possibile link papers between them and to note in [[2.00_General_notes-Comp_Bio/README]] when possible.

If i can add features of diffent way to use is report them here.


Idea of organization (this channel here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T0q2kQwc2o&t=127s) and he's inspired form here (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA/playlists)

What i need to do:

1) Find a template for research papers
2) organize forlders based on the yt videos i've found. Create in each subdirectory a link with the orignal paper in #all_papers
3) Understand and plan MOC, the structure above might change radically
