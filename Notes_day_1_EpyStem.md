General Notes on EpyStem conference 2022

## Speakers Notes
- *Victor Corces* (Atlanta, US): Antagonistic effect between DNAmeth and BPA induced CTFC-sites. Cuttting off CTFC site inside FTO gene (connected to BPA exposure) and mice do not responde to BPA exposure and don't get fat anymore. BPA affects the number of a certain types of neurons (ones that are responsible for regulating hunger).
	- BPA exposure of pregnate females can resutls in changes in TF binding that are transmitted to subsequent generations and correlates with obesity.

- *Maria Elena Torres-Padilla* (Munchen, GE): Zygote/2-cell/8-cells/blastocyst. 2-cell stage seems like when the cells loose totipotency (after is pluripotency), though cells stay plastic. Pericentromeric regions and .. are transcribed after fertilization.
	- Can we identify some TF that can reverse differentiated cells to pluripotency (already exist) and then to totipotency?? Totipotency vs pluripotency cells have higher expression of retrotrasposons and de condence chromatin. *CAF1* leads to chromatin assembly and downregulation of it can induce 2ClCs (2 cell-like cell). CAF-1 can regulate a subset of genes in the vicinity of active MERVL.
At the beginning of development (zygote to 8 cell) DNA replication is very slow and slowing down the replication fork speed induces a 2CLC reprogramming. WHY?? 2CLCs induced by slowing down the fork speed have increased reprogrammability and plasicity.
Transposable elements are heterochromatic.
Why are 2CLCs reprogrammed during S-phase?
Slowing fork speed improves the reprogramming of efficiency if somatic cell nuclear transfer
(conclusion iphone).

- *Pablo Navarro* (Pasteur, France): Photo Iphone on biological cost of mitotis. Pluripotency TFs `(nanogn, Oct4, Sox2, Esrrb, Gata6, nsd1, trim24, snw1, rxrb, ppil1, esrra, nrob1)`.  During mitosis, regardless of the chromatin modification, ..... Also chromatin accessibility during mitosis it's the same or slightly decreased but it's still there. When profiling nucleosome though, during Mitotis there are some nucleosome invasions not present in interpahse. Chromosome reshuffles and active histone modifications (at promoters, enhancers..) go away.
After mitosis there's a massive wave of transcription. ~250 genes requires CTCF and ~350 requitre Esrrb/Nr5a2 to be reactivated. `MYC` is the only motif that is statistically sign at fast/strong promoters during hypertranscriptional state, but it's evicted during mitosis.

- *Miguel Ramalho-Santos* (Toronto, Canada): Stem cells can go into hypertranscription. Housekeeping genes are a great % of the whole genes. Single cell RNAseq required spike in ERCC normalization or UMI.
During regeneration, hypertranscription precedes proliferation. ^9cc638

- *Christopher Todd* (Reik lab, ALTOS Lal): Early mouse epiblast appear to epigenetically preparing certain lineage enhancers ahead fo their activation. Enhancer priming is associated with key developmental gene netwkors. 

- *Maria Matarazzo* (IGB-ABT):  boh

- *Alexandrer Meissner* (Berlin, Germany): cancer epigenome and cancer methylome. CpGi are also part of DNA methylation valley (DMV). In cancer it's postulated that during carcinogenesis CpGis and Methylation valley acquire methylation and genome wide is lost. What if cancer epiginome is a higly regulated epigenetic state that can be swithced on (and off) rapidly.
	Thousands of promoters beyond classic tumor suppressor genes gain methylation during cariconogenesis. Genetic swithces and drivers can change can happen in a rather stable epigenetic background. The cancer epigenome can be created in a fe days and without mutations. 
- *Beatrice Bodega* (INGM): TE are interspesed in the genome and increase transcriptional complexity.

	- *Eva Bartova* (Brno, Czech Rep):
