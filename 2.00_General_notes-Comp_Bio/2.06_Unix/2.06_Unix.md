* When creating symlinks (ln -s) it super easy to create one that's broken. The error is :

```
"OSError: [Errno 40] Too many levels of symbolic links: path/to/link" with python "Too many levels of symbolic links" with find command *find -L -xtype l* in the dir of the symlink  
```

An easy fix to this is *ALWAYS* specify the full path for the source file. This prevents broken links.    

* Cleaver way to remove header form a file (usually a bed):
```
tail -n +2 file.txt > file.stdout
```
