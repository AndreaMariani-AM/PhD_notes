1) take IS53S ring paper and overlap targets with WT new to see new binding

## Diego

1) Are P1 targets higly expressed the one with higher peak values? or values are the same between P1 high expression and P1 low expression?
2) What is the basal levels of RING1B targets that get upregulated and the one that do not? Is basal level a barrier/requirements to be able to be upregulated?
3) Show that 20% of targets that aren't downregulated now have a similar trend to the ones that are repressed and therefore it's a statistical issue.
4) Take Downregulated targets between rescue/stable and upregulated wt/stable. Do they overlap? if so the repression is specif and not random as with the rescue i'm repressing the same genes that are upregulated once i introduce RING cat dead.
5) Heatmap between I53S ring and 24KO ring at Wt ring targets. Does 24KO ring is higher?

Single cell
1) EEDKO accumulation of goblet(muc), delocalization paneth(Lyz+) and there should be a population with somehow shared features between goblet and paneth. P6KO should accumulate tuft.
