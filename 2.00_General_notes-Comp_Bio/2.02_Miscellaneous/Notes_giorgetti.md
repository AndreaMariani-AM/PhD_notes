## Summary
*Towards a quantitative understanding of long range transcriptional regulation*, [by Luca Giorgetti](https://giorgettilab.org/) at [FMI Base](https://www.fmi.ch/).

## Notes
-  [laat and duboule nature 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24153303/)
- cohesin extrude 1Kb per second
- non acetylated cohesin can extrude, acetylated ones cannot
- CTCF stops extrusion and is a constrain for tads
- TADs favor enhancer-promoter interacitons within domains 
- Does any contact between enhancer-promoter leads to the production of an RNA molecule
- assumption: probability that enhancer sees a promoter refleces the possibility of activating it, the less (different tads) it sees it, the less it should activate it
- power law decay for enhancer-promoter communication (inside the same tad) ~ 10x decay, but outside that TADs it only drops by a factir of 2 (no more 10).
- Luca wants to quantify the idea that *transcription levels are a function of the probability of contacts between enhancer and promoters*.
- Measuring transctiption vs contact probability.
- *Transcriptional activation form anywhere in the TAD* and *TAD boundaries matter*: they insulate (constrain) enhancer function. When the enhancer is moved (transposase experiment) to another TADs, it cannot activate the promoter. It's true that distance from the promoter matters and decay *in a non linear fashion*  as you move away, but it has never been quantified. 
- burst frequency of PolII, two state behavior *CHECK IT OUT*, genes are OFF - ON - OFF again and during the ON phase mRNA si produced.
- when an enhancer is in contact with a promoter can increase the fequency at which the promoter swtiches on.
- A single CTCF site has a huge effect on the enhancer strength.
- Enhacer effect/insulation are a funciton of:
	- Distance from the promoter
	- enhancer strength
	- presence of CTCF sites
	- TADs boundaries
	-  Nonlinear relationship between transcription and contact probabilities.
- The presence of Cohesin an loop extrusion, increases the frequency of contacts and the average duration.
- Cohesin and CTCF loop determine timing and duration of chromosomal "contacts" (i.e. proximity ~ 150nm)
