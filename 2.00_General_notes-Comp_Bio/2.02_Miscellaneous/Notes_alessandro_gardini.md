## Summary
Notes on a seminar.

## Notes
- Multitasking Integrator protein complex. Binds RNApol II c terminus. Different modules in the same complex. Talk on phosphatase module specifically.
- Pause and pause-relase of Pol II after 15-60 nucleotides. To elongate succesfully, needs a kinases (CDK9 aka pTEFb). Unleashed (defective pausing) elongation distrupts the trancscriptional homeostasis of a tissue, may leed to neoplastic transformation.
- PP2A phospatase complex. 3 Main parts, A, B and C. It's been discovered that PP2A can bind to the intergrator complex and form a non canonical complex. For elongation now it's essential to recruit CDK9 and also PP2A activity. Phospo-driven biological processes occurring at chromatin.
- INTS6 and 12 are putative tumour suppressors. Genes that loss this module in cancer showd enrichement of E2F and MYC.
