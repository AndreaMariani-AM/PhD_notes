What it is about very briefly

## Speakers Notes
- *Dirk Schubeler* (Basel, Switzerland): Direct repression and indirect repression of transcription(this one recruits proteins that cause euchromation). Some TF are methylation sensitive (direct repressone), BNP and nrf1. For indirect repession, MBDs binding CpG (1,2,4 and MECP2). SETDB1 can represss ERVs in mESC even in the absence of DNA meth. QuadrupleKO of MBDS (and MECP2) cause a super modest differentual expression. ATAC-seq in DNMT TKO changes, chrom acessibility changes, in .
- MBD-QKO doesn't. IAPs aren't silenced anymore in TKO. Evidence that blocking methylation ssensitive TFs in the prevalent pathway to silcence CG dense regulatory regions in genes and repeats by DNA methylation.
- *Wendy Bickmore* (Edinburgh, UK): Enhancers biology, non coding regions of the genome and we don;t have a full list of them. Regulatory domains are contained within topological associated domains (TADs). You need loop extrusion (cohesin) to activate enhancers only for long range ones, undre <100kb (proximal) isn't strictly necessary. Polycomb is a great inducer of long range interactions with the chromatin.
- *Michiel Vermulen*: 
- *Luciano Di Croce* (CRG, Barcellona): repulsion of polII machinery after creating polycomb domains. ALmost every subunit of polycomb is mutated in cancer. PCl3 (PRC2.2) deppletion alters mESCs differentiation, can cause a reorganization of PRC2 and miss-mutate in caner. KO cause a defect in the hematopeietic system (but no leukimia has ever been developed in mice in this time frame). Genome reorganize upo PML-RARa expression, 10% goes from compartment A to B during development of leukimia.
- *Patrick Lim* (Jerusalem): SET$\alpha$ ans its role in preventing aberrant H3K4me3 removal. EZH2 seems to interact with SET$\alpha$ and seems to be enriched at KDM5B/PRC2 silent genes.
- *Alexander van Oudenaarden* (Utrecht, NL): Replication velocity might depend in underlying sequence/chromatin, cdll state, cell type. During the end of the s-phase cells double uop their velocity. If there is no transcription, replication speeds up even more. The velocity in the early s-phase might be explained because the cell has to repair single strand damages caused by the transcription itself.
