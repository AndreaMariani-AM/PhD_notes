1) take IS53S ring paper and overlap targets with WT new to see new binding


## Karin

1) Heatmaps for singature, take a gene if is different in any of the conditions and use only them. Show gene names
2) take only the ones that are significant in at least a condition and then do another heatmap of normalized expression values, WT00-96 and then PCGF1
3) statistics on boxplots H2AUbq, 96 ws 96 P1ko and then 96Wt vs 96 rescue.

## Diego

1) take PCGF1 targets from Scelfo, take the top 25% expressed and bottom in WT. Top should have no H2AUb1 and RING1B while the other should. Now look at the stable, the low portion now should be derepressed, look at the transcriptional activity. Is it roughly the same as the top 25% in stable (they should remain active of course) or is is some fold less? In othe words if the expression now is roughly the same, the ability of RING1B to re repress its own target ISN't dependent on transcription.
