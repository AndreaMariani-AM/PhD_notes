## Summary
Notes on Fold change and its implications

## Notes
* Fold Change: describes how much a quantity changes between an original and a subsequent quantification. It's the ratio between two quantities. As an example, *for two quantities A and B the fold change of B with respect to A is B/A. In other words, a change from 30 to 60 is described as a fold change of 2 or a one-fold increase. 2 fold = 2 times = double*. Easier to interpret than the difference between two states. A draw back is that can missclassify samples with a great difference (B-A) but small ratio (B/A) when analyzing changes at high expression levels, and it's also unstable for very small denominators and the measurement can be affected by noise.
