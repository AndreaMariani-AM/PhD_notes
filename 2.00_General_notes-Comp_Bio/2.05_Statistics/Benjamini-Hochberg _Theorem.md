## Summary
Brief intuition on *BH Theorem and correction* method

## Notes
- it says that if *P values* are *independent* this procedure controls the [[FDR]], which means that it can guarantes that *among X p values*, corrected and still significant, which corresponds to *X hypotheses*, you will have at most 5% of them be *false discoveries*. 
- *FDR* only guarantees you that among a list of P values, only 5% of them are *false positives* but says *NOTHING* about any member of that list.
