## Summary
This note contains info on local regression. Concept found in [[Blanco2021]] (*SpikChIP*).
A good resource is the [book](https://rafalab.github.io/pages/754/section-03.pdf) from Rafael Irizzary @[rafalab](https://rafalab.github.io/)

## Notes
-  Used to model a relation between a predictor variable and a response variable. A simple fixed model would be:
$Yi = f(x) + \epsilon i$
where $f(x)$ is an unknown function and $\epsilon i$ is an error term
