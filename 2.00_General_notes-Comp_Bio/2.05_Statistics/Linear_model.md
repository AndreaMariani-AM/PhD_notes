## Summary
Statistics class of SEMM

## Notes
- Epsilon is the error, $\epsilon$, and the geneal formula for a linear mode is: (insert here latex)
- Best estimator fof error variance? ei = xi - xmean, then the error variance is the sum of xi - xmean. The sample variance, aka the error variance, is the best estimate of the true population variance, according to least squared method. In the same way, the best estimator for the true mean of the population is the sample mean.
- CI are necessary the state that our sample mean is reasonably close to the true population mean.s
