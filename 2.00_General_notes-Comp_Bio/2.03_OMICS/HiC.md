## Summary
This  is a note in HiC technology.

## Notes
- Extension method of the 3C method. 3C, 5C or Hi-C can map each bound protein to the target gene/s helps to regulate or the genomic region/s with which it interacts to form a hogher order chromatin structure. Hi-C and 5C derive from 3C (chromatin conformation capture). Steps of 3C are: crosslink genomic regions in close proximity, digest DNA with restriction enzymes to create pairs of crosslinked DNA fragments that originated form distant genomic locations, identify these pairs (paired-end seq) after ligation and amplification of the fragments. 3C requires primers for regions of interest --> low throughput. 5C use thousands of primers but still limited to the size of genomic region that can be assayed. Hi-C doesn't depend on primers but incorporates biotynilates residues after restriction enzyme digestion that allow fragments to be pulled down using streptavidin beads. Extremely deep sequencing is required to confidently identify all interactions.
