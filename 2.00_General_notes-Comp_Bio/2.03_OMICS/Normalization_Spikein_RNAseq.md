## Summary
What it is about very briefly

## Notes
- [[Notes_day_1_EpyStem#^9cc638]] look up RNAseq normalization with Spike in ERCCs, some discussion [here](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/52/normalization-methods-with-rna-seq-ercc-spike-in) 
- Rob Klose uses spike-ins for RNAseq experiments. *Spikein calibration* is done using read counts from a unique set of dm6 refGene genes to calcualte DESeq2 size factors for normalization of raw mm10 read counts. Info can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109727651930228X?via%3Dihub) and [here](https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/000114514)
