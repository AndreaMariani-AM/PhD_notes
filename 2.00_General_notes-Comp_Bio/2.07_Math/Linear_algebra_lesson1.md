## Summary
Coursera course on mathmatics for machine learning, can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning?courseSlug=linear-algebra-machine-learning&showOnboardingModal=checkAndRedirect&specialization=mathematics-machine-learning)

## Notes
- in a funciton like this one: $10a + 3b = 10$ numbers are called *constant linear coefficients*, that relate the *input variables* $a$ and $b$ to the output 10
- Vectors are represented with square brackets, matrices with round brackets
- $\mu$ this is mu, $\sigma$  this is sigma. Useful for normal or gaussian distribution $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2*\pi}} exp^{-1/2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2$ 
- calculus on vectors to understand how to move vectors in a space of fitting parameters and find the values that minimize sum of squares residuals and then the best fitting parameters for the data. For a gaussian that would be to find the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that best describe a Gaussin distribution
- Vector math --> calculus --> machine learning
