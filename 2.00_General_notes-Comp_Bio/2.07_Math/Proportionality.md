## Notes
- In math, two sequences of numbers, often experimental data, are *proportional* or *directly proportional* if their corresponding elements have a *constant ratio*. which is then called the *proportionality ratio or constant* 
- This is the *proportionality sign* $$\large \varpropto$$
and given two variables $\large x$ and $\large y$ , $\large x$ and $\large y$  are proportional if theres a non-zero *constast* $\large k$ such that $$\Large y = kx$$
and so $$\Large y \varpropto x$$
- This concept is importa in [[Genome_Informatics#^2e4424]] when describing why it's better to use *TPM* and not *RPKM* or *FPKM*.
