## Summary

Spatially resolved genome-wide histone modifications combining in situ *CUT&TAG* chemistry, microfluidic deterministic *barcoding* and *NGS*. *Spatial CUT&TAG* revealed spatial patternig of cell types determined by histone modification in mouse brain

## Notes
- Despite efforts to profile the epigenome in single cells, it's hard to integrate the spatial information of individual cells in the tissue of origin
