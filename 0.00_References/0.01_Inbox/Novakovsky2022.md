## Summary
ExplaiNN is and adaptation of neural additive model that makes prediction based on linear combination of multiple indipendent [[Convolutional_neural_network(CNNs)]] and each has a single convolutional filter and fully connected layers. Brings both of both words, expressivity on CNNs and explainability of linear regression giving gloabal (cell state level) and local (individual sequence level)
In the paper is used to predict TF binding and chromatin accessibility states.
