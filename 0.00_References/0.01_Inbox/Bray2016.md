## Summary
*Kallisto* is an RNAseq quantification tool two orders of magnitude *faster* than previous approaches and achieves *similar/better* results. *Kallisto pseudoaligns* reads to a reference, producing a list of transcripts that are compatible with each read while avoiding the *alignment of individual bases*. It's approach is similar to a paper that would be publish few moths after this one, [[Patro2017]] that introduced a software called *salmon* and the concept of [[Quasi-mapping]].

## Notes
- Relies on the usage of *k-mers* and an *hash-based approach* to speed up RNAseq quantification. They've tried to assess what are the *key* requirements for *accurate* quantification, where *accurate* is defined as `assignment of reads that cannot be uniquely aligned`. Which is a hard step in alignments/quantification that software have to deal with.
- RNAseq statistical models account for multimapping-reads and probabilistically assign them while inferring *miximum likelihood estimates* of transcripts abundances.
- It's been shown by [Nicolae et al](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/estimation-of-alternative-splicing-isoform-frequencies-from-rna-s)that accurate quantification *doesn't require* information on *where inside* the transcripts the reads might have been generated from but rather *which* transcripts could have generated them. This is the idea that generated *pseudoalignment* of reads and fragments, which focuses on identifying the transcripts *from which* the reads might have been generated from and *doesn't try to pinpoint exactly how the sequences of the reads and transcripts align*.
