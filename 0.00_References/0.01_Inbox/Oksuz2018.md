## Summary
They define *nucleation* and *spreading* regions for *PRC2*:
- PRC2 nucleation at a subset of *CpG islands* forms *spatial clusters* in the nucleus
- *JARID2* and *MTF2* increase the stability of PRCS at its own nucleation sites
- Initial PRC2 forms *H3K27me3* foci within the nucleus
- After nucleation, PRC2 spreads *H3K27me3* in `cis` and in `far-cis` via 3D contacts

## Notes
- *EED* is necessary to stabilize PRC2. Disruption of *EED-H3K27me3* reduces the H3K27me3 levels. If the aromatic ring is mutated it shows a *LOSS* of *H3k27me2/3* and a *GAIN* of *H3K36me2* (associated with *active transcription*). Thought H3K27me3 was stil detectable. 
- At discrete regions( ~ 200 where 73% are $\pm$ 5kb of the *TSS*) with larger polycomb domains, *H3K27me3* was maintened ~ like the *WT*. 
- *EED-H3k27me3* interaction is essential for spreading me3 *in cis along the chromosome*.
- *H3K27me3* first deposits at nucleations sites (some *CpGi*), while *H3K27me2* accumulates less at Nucleation sites and more proximal at 12hr. At 36hr, *Me3* accumulates more at nucleation sites and also spreads across the chromosome. *Me2* anticorrelates with Me3 and lose the mark at the nucleation sites and spreads MORE at proximal. *EED mutants* shows no *Me3* and *Me2* is retained and accumulates at Nucleation sites much like *Me3* in WT conditions, but ineficiently at proximal sites
