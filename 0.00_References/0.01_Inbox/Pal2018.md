## Summary
The Study of 3D organization of chromatin through HiC is incredibly complex due to the recent advancement in technologies. Hi-C is a high thoughput method for measuring pairwise contacts between virtually any pair of genomic loci. In this review the authors try to disentangle the complexity in softwares and data analysis steps necessary to analise such complex datasets.

## Notes
- 6 Billion nucleotides compose a diploid genome.
- *3-C*, Chromatin Conformation Capture, was the first low throughput technique [[HiC]].
- The number of pairwise contact grows exponentially with the genome length -> large and complex datasets.
Most notes are here [[HiC_pipeline]] or [[HiC]], given that this is a review.
