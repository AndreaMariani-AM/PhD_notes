# Organization of the folders
## 0.00_References
In this dierctory i store an inbox and reference metadata subdirectories

- *0.01_Inbox* : contains notes that are just the template with filled in info but empty on the main body. They stay there untill the paper is read and notes are taken. When it happens, then the note is moved to 0.002_References_meta. PDFs are not stored here.
- *0.02_Reference_meta* : contains notes for a specific paper. **ALL** file names must be have the same format:
	- AuthorsName_year
	This are the actual notes that have to be referenced in later notes or in MOCs

## 0.10_Templates
In this directory i store various templates

- *0.11_Template_research_paper* : contains a template for notes to be used in *0.00_References/0.01_Inbox* or *0.02_Reference_meta*.
- *0.12_Template_notes* : contains a template for general notes, ideally for MOCs on broader subjects or for *2.00_General_notes-Comp_Bio*.

## 1.00_Papers_List
In this directory and subdirectory i store the index (00_Index_papers) of the papers that have been read and taken notes on. Divided by topics the index is linked back to its original note. There's also a section *ADD REFERENCE* that can be used as an inbox for papers to read.

- *1.01_Inbox* : contains the PDF files that are yet to be embedded into notes. They are the corresponding PDFs of notes in *0.00_References/0.01_Inbox*. Once the note is drafted, moved it to the related subfolder based on the context.
- *1.0x_Field* : all of these subdierectories contain PDF files that are embedded into a note that's located in *0.00_References/0.02_Reference_meta*
